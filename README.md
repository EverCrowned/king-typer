## About

King Typer is a website created for the infoeducatie contest and it's main goal is to compete with the current typing websites that either have old designs, bad UX or even both and to become a nice enviroment for learning and practicing touch typing.

The developement for King Typer will continue even after the contest until I am happy with the results.

This is a monorepo, containing both the API and the front-end that are hosted separately on heroku.

You can visit the website here -> [King Typer](https://king-typer-web.herokuapp.com/)
