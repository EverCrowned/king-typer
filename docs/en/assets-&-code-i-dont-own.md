# Assets and code I haven't made myself:

- The github logo in the footer I got from [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/107112/github_six_icon);
- The keyboard image was from [ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/learn/)
- The tutorial was partially copied and modified from the same website [ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/learn/)
- The definition of touch typing is patially taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing)
- Some text from the random text in the home page that has the typing animation is fun facts taken from diverse websites from the internet.
- Some of the configs for webpack, prettier, eslint are taken from other repositories of mine or of my friends.
- Text fonts are mainly taken from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


- The typing text animation is made using a dependency called [react-rotating-text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rotating-text)
- The charts are made using a dependency called [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)

A list with all the dependencies can be found [here](blob/master/package.json), [here](blob/master/packages/web/package.json) and [here](blob/master/packages/api/package.json), of course I don't own any of the dependencies.

## Contributors

All the code in the repo was written by me.

- The [semantic-release-bot](https://github.com/Vyctor661/king-typer/commits?author=semantic-release-bot) is a bot that creates CHANGELOG files automatically based on my commits and determines the versions of the app. [Semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is a dependency.
- If you are wondering why are there contributors in my [README](blob/master/README.md), its because they are people who helped me with ideas, design and coding tips.
